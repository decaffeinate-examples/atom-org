// This custom subclass of CustomEvent exists to provide the ::abortKeyBinding
// method, as well as versions of the ::stopPropagation methods that record the
// intent to stop propagation so event bubbling can be properly simulated for
// detached elements.
//
// CustomEvent instances are exotic objects, meaning the CustomEvent constructor
// *must* be called with an exact CustomEvent instance. We work around this fact
// by building a CustomEvent directly, then injecting this object into the
// prototype chain by setting its __proto__ property.
