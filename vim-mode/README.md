## Vim Mode package [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atom/vim-mode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atom/vim-mode)

Provides Vim modal control for Atom, blending the best of Vim and Atom.

### Current Status - DEPRECATED in favor of [vim-mode-plus](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus)

We're not maintaining this package anymore, because `vim-mode-plus` has more features and is very well maintained.
