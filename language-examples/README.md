# Language Examples

These are examples of all languages that come bundled with Atom. Use them to test syntax highlighting when creating a theme.


## How to use?

1. Open your theme in Atom.
2. Clone or download this repo.
3. Open that folder in "Dev Mode" (View > Developer > Open In Dev Mode...). You'll see a red icon bottom/right in the status bar. Opening in Dev Mode will automatically reload the styles when you save.
4. Now, click through `languages` files to make sure all languages are supported.

## Contributing

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to improve the examples.

Each language file comes with two sections:

1. A __simple example__ of the language. Its purpose is to show a typical use case and get a quick overall impression.

2. If needed __more__ examples or tests can be added. Or maybe show a few edge cases.
