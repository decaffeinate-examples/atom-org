## Testing

This project currently doesn't have automated tests. However, it is used by the [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) and [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) projects, and changes may be manually tested against these:

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Make your changes
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm link` ([documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link))
6. Setup [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/docs#build-documentation) and [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/blob/master/docs/contributing/setup.md) development directories
7. Run `npm link eagle-eagle` in your Atom and GitHub Deskop development directories
8. Run `script/build` in your Atom and GitHub Deskop development directories (these processes invoke legal-eagle and may fail if you introduced a crash or false negative license detection)

You can repeat steps 3, 4, and 8 without repeating the others.
